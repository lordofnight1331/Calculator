## About the Project

This project is a **simple, functional, and aesthetic calculator** that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage calculation, toggling signs, and deleting inputs.

The goal of this project was not only to build a calculator but to understand and implement **DOM manipulation**, **JavaScript logic**, and **responsive design** using **pure front-end technologies**.

Whether you are just getting started or revisiting the basics, this calculator app provides a hands-on approach to learning and practicing core web development skills.
